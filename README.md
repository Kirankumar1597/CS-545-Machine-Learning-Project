 The original TAU Vehicle Type Recognition Dataset from Kaggle consists of 17 different vehicle classes which added up to give a total of 36,000 images. 
 Among the 36,000 images, we used only 9,000 images for training, validation and testing with five vehicle classes namely bicycle, bus, car, motorcycle and van.
