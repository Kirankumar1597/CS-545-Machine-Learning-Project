    "In this project we will be doing Image Classification using convolutional neural networks on any one of the Vehicle Dataset available online. The motivation behind our project idea is the homework assignment A3 where we applied our Neural Network Classifier class model to classify the MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset. To make the machines classify the objects like how humans do upon visualization is very interesting and yet a challenging topic to address. We are going to address this topic through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply the convolutional neural network learning algorithm taught in class to the vehicle dataset of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze the results with train and test accuracy obtained on using the optimizer functions covered in class (SGD, ADAM and SCG). \n",
    "\n",
    "* To visualize the images along with the network predictions to help us understand how the neural network model makes decisions based on the hyperparameters learning rate, number of epochs, optimizer function/method used, hidden layer structure and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learning algorithm using Pytorch for classification and compare the results."

    "**The following are the steps involved in the completion of this project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Data Collection:** There are large number of vehicle datasets are available online in different sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Google's Dataset Search Engine and so on from which we need to identify the apt dataset that rightly serves the purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Training the network model:** The network model will be trained using CNN learning algorithm and also will be trained using CNN defined in Pytorch by directly calling the neural network torch functions from the network model. Each network model will be trained for different configurations of hyperparameters i.e., for different values of learning rate, number of epochs, number of hidden layers and the number hidden units present in each layer, and lastly for different optimizer functions SGD, ADAM and SCG on the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Source Code:** We are planning to write our own code with the help of Homework Assignments A3 (Neural Network Classifier) and A4 (Convolutional Neural Networks) meanwhile we will be referring web articles like TowardsDataScience and GitHub to build the CNN model and understand the concepts involved while defining the CNN model and the necessary functions that need to be defined for classifying the different classes of vehicles from the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Testing the network model:** This is the most important part of the project, we need to validate whether the network model defined in the code while training using the train dataset correctly predicts the different classes of vehicles present in the test dataset on testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Plotting of results:** To Identify the best configuration for which the built CNN model is compiled by carrying out enough number of experiments for different learning rates, epochs, hidden unit structures and methods, and then plot the necessary graphs that compares the values of train, validation and test accuracy achieved and the losses incurred on compilation of the CNN model.\n"
